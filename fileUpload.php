 * The global $_FILES will contain all the uploaded file information. 
 * Its contents from the example form is as follows. Note that this assumes
 * the use of the file upload name userfile, as used in the example script above. 
 * This can be any name.
 * 
 * $_FILES['userfile']['name']
The original name of the file on the client machine.

$_FILES['userfile']['type']
The mime type of the file, if the browser provided this information. An example would be "image/gif". This mime type is however not checked on the PHP side and therefore don't take its value for granted.

$_FILES['userfile']['size']
The size, in bytes, of the uploaded file.

$_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']
The temporary filename of the file in which the uploaded file was stored on the server.

$_FILES['userfile']['error']
The error code associated with this file upload.
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
Be sure your file upload form has attribute enctype="multipart/form-data" otherwise the file upload will not work.

#important to only allow upload for files that don't affect your PHP code. (or only those files you need)
#after the user uploads the file, we basically run a few checks:

if (isset($_FILES['upload'])){
	
	#let's first make a whitelist of allowed extensions
	$allowedextensions = array('jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif', 'png');
	
	#now if the user uplaoded an allowed format, we want to know what format that was
	#the following variable will store the extension, all in lower-case
	#substr() is a function that takes only a portion of a string - we need only what comes after the dot
	#we need to get everything after the LAST dot, looking for the extension
	#strrpos returns the position of the last occurrence of a substring in a string
	#we use the file name and a dot to find the extension: strrpos($_FILES['upload']['name'], '.')
	#but we also need to add one space to ignore the dot, so we write +1 at the end.
	#strtolower function changes all capital letters to lower-string so JPG becomes jpg and it fits your whitelist
	#you should take the entire string and put it in 'strtolower'
	$extension = strtolower(substr($_FILES['upload']['name'], strrpos($_FILES['upload']['name'], '.') + 1));
	
	#test by echoing out what you upload
	echo "Your file extension is: ".$extension;
	
	#we create an array called 'error' to store all our errors, so we can later use them.
	$error = array ();
	
	#here we do our first check, we basically want it to pass so we can upload.
	#if it does not pass, then we give an error.
	#we say, check to see if "externsions" can be found in our array "allowedextensions"
	#if the extension is NOT in the array, we return the error message (we actually add it into the array)
	if(in_array($extension, $allowedextensions) === false){
		
		#add a new array entry
		$error[] = 'This is not an image, upload is allowed only for images.';        
	}
	
	#it is also good to think about the size of the file you want to accept.
	#this is for images, so how big of an image would you like to accept?
	#this is in bytes, and 1000000 is actually 1 mb which is now our limit
	if($_FILES['upload']['size'] > 1000000){
		
		$error[]='The file exceeded the upload limit';
	}
	
	
	#now you do the 'final check' to see if there are no errors in the array.
	#if they array is empty = no errors have been written in it.
	#if there is something in the array 'errors' that means an error has occured and we should not upload
	
	if(empty($error)){
		
		#this is our starding point, in order to upload we need to move the file (uploaded file)
		#all the way to the location we want to store it.
		#But, before we do so it will be good to do all of the ABOVE written first
		#We check for errors that might disturb our code, and try to avoid them
		#if there are no errrors move the file to the desired file location
		move_uploaded_file($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'], "uploadedfiles/{$_FILES['upload']['name']}");     
	}
